## Web Stack Intro :card_index_dividers:

A web stack refers to the set of technologies used to build a web application. It typically comprises an operating system, a server, a database, and a programming language. The combination of these layers forms an environment that allows web applications to be created, run, and managed.

Web stacks are crucial for the development, operation, and maintenance of web applications. They provide the necessary environment for coding, testing, and deploying applications, thereby enabling the functionality of websites and online services we use daily.

### What is back-end?

The back-end, often referred to as the "server-side", is the part of a web application that operates behind the scenes. It is responsible for managing and organizing data, implementing the business logic of an application, and communicating with the front-end. It is typically built using languages like Java, Python, Ruby, Node.js, and frameworks such as Django, Express, or Rails.

The back-end interacts with databases to retrieve, store, or manipulate data, which is then sent to the front-end for display to the user. This process involves the use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that act as a bridge between the front-end and back-end. Security, performance, and data integrity are all critical aspects of back-end development.
